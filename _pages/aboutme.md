## Introduction
Hi, I'm a Master's student in Electrical Engineering at KAIST, where I also received my Bachelor degree (2021 - 2025). My research focuses on Computer Architecture, with a specific interest in Interconnection Networks, Memory Systems, Chiplet-based Architectures, and Hardware for AI. I'm conducting research under the guidance of Prof. John Kim, aiming to develop innovative architectural solutions for next-generation computing systems.
