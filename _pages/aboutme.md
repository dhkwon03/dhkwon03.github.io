## Introduction
Hi, I'm undergraduate student at KAIST. I entered KAIST in 2021 and I am majoring in Electrical Engineering. I am interested in Computer Architecture, especially on Interconnection Network, Memory Architecture, Chiplet, and AI. I gained experience in computer programming since I was young. I have participated in numerous software and programming contests and won lots of awards including three grand awards given by the minister of science and technology. Now I'm conducting cutting-edge research under the guidance of Prof. John Kim, focusing on innovative architecture and performance optimization.
